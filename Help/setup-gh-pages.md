Alright, my GitHub-pushing partner in crime! Let's get this bad boy up on GitHub Pages faster than you can say "git push origin master". Here's what we're gonna do:

1. First, we need to add a few scripts to your `package.json`. Open that file and add these lines to the "scripts" section:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "export": "next export",
  "deploy": "next build && next export && touch out/.nojekyll && git add out/ && git commit -m \"Deploy to gh-pages\" && git subtree push --prefix out origin gh-pages"
}
```

2. Next, we need to create a `next.config.js` file in the root of your project. Add this content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  basePath: '/Next-js-better-you-app',
  assetPrefix: '/Next-js-better-you-app/',
}
```

3. Now, create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file with this content:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Export
        run: npm run export

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./out
```

4. In your `next.config.js`, add this line to handle image optimization:

```javascript
images: {
  loader: 'akamai',
  path: '',
},
```

5. Now, commit all these changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

6. Finally, go to your GitHub repo settings, navigate to "Pages", and set the source to the "gh-pages" branch.

Now, every time you push to the main branch, GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your app to GitHub Pages.

Remember, bro, deploying to GitHub Pages is like sending your app to college - it's gonna live on its own now, make you proud, and occasionally ask for money for "textbooks" (aka server costs).

Let me know if you hit any snags, and we'll troubleshoot faster than you can chug a protein shake!
